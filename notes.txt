we have to create a sever (express server) so that it "listens" to the request from client side and listen on a port so that anyone can connect 


app.use((req,res)=>{
    res.send("hello from the server")
}) 
this function is called a response handler




app.use("/",(req,res)=>{
    res.send("hello from the server")
})

app.use("/test",(req,res)=>{
    res.send("hello from test page")
})

app.use("/hello",(req,res)=>{
    res.send("hello from hello page")
}) 
if you use this order the issue is with .use method 
even if you change the port to /hello or /test it shows "hello from the server"
why?
    bcz .use matches the "/" first and  shows it in the hello and test port 
    fix 
        1- .use-> .get
        2- change the order d
